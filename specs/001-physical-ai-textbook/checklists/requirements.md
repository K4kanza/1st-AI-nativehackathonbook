# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

| Category | Items Checked | Items Passed | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Content Quality | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| Requirement Completeness | 8 | 8 | PASS |
| Feature Readiness | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| **Total** | **16** | **16** | **PASS** |

## Notes

- All items passed validation on first iteration
- Specification is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
- User stories align with the three stakeholder types from user input (Student, Instructor, Researcher)
- All success criteria are measurable without implementation details
- Scope boundaries clearly delineate humanoid robotics from broader robotics field
